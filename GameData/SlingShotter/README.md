# KerbalSlingshotter

This is a very simple Kerbal Space Program plugin to display the positions
of all planets, moons, and the current vessel after a selected time
interval.  

It's helpful especially for gravity slingshots, for example
not having to "sweep" your node path across the orbit of a Joolian moon
in order to find an encounter.  You can simply select the time where you 
would intersect the moon's orbit, and the plugin will show you where the 
moon actually is.

It's also helpful for visualizing the position of two planets as time 
progresses, to better plan interplanetary transfers.  There are other
tools that will do that calculation for you, but this is a more hands-on
approach.
